        Bihar (/bɪˈhɑːr/; Hindi pronunciation: [bɪˈɦaːr] (About this soundlisten)) is a state in eastern India.
        It is the third-largest state by population and twelfth-largest by territory,
        with an area of 94,163 km2 (36,357 sq mi). It is contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west,
        Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, and with Jharkhand to the south.
        The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges, which flows from west to east. Three main cultural
        regions converge in the state: Magadh, Mithila, and Bhojpur. In ancient and classical India,
        the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture. From Magadha
        arose India\'s first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world\'s most widely
        adhered-to religions: Buddhism. Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya
        and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule.
        Another region of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.

    <string name="vikramshila">
        Ruins of Vikramshila:","The royal university of Vikramsila, 38 km from Bhagalpur ranks next
        to Nalanda and owes its origin to Dharmapala (770-810 A.D.), the devout Pala king who loved
        to call himself Paramasaugata (chief worshipper of the Buddha)and was a great patron of Mahayana
        Buddhism.Dharmapala was impressed by two things which prompted him to establish Vikramsila university.
        Firstly, the rocky hillock anchored around the confluence of Kosi and Ganga at Vateshwarasthan
        was not only a scenic attraction but a popular tantric site as evident from the presence of a
        Kali temple (instead of Parvati’s) in front of Shiva temple, besides various other caves and
        rock cut sculptures dating back to the 6\\7th century A.D. Secondly, the place was
        with pilgrimage due to Uttarbahini which drew large crowds during Varsavardhana.
        Unlike Nalanda, sources of information on Vikramsila is confined to Tibetan texts and
        they make us believe that Dharmapala in his earlier birth was an accomplished acharya,
        Kampilya, who had attained siddhi or perfection in Mahayana mudra mysticism here and
        was determined to build a monastery one day.

        Vishnu under the title of Madhusudana or the destroyer of a demon called Madhu who
        was killed by Vishnu and then covered by the Mandar hill. Kalidasa\’s kumarasamahava
